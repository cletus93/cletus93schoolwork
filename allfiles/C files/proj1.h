After you have about five or six hours and are proficient in the four
fundamentals: stalls, the wind correction maneuvers, and elementary
emergencies, the period of shooting takeoffs and landings will begin.
Maybe you feel that takeoffs and landings are the most important parts of
flying, but as far as your training is concerned there are just another
maneuver.
The average sutdent even places more weight on landings than takeoffs.
Takeoffs are not important, he thinks, but landings are.
So with this attitude he finds himself having plenty of trouble when it
comes to getting the bird in the air.
The instructor will have you follow him through on the takeoffs during the
first flight or two, and probably by the third or fourth flight you will be
making most of the takeoffs yourself.
Most of the trainers being used thoday are the tricycle gear types.
As was the case for taxiing, the lower nose position gives better visibility
during the ground roll parts of the takeoff and landing.

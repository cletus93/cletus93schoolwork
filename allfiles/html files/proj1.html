		<h3>Childhood</h3>
			<p class = "indent"><pre>
			Growing up I have always loved the outdoors.  This being the case I choose at a very young age I was going to be a boyscout.  I loved every minute of being a scout and eventually succeeded in becoming an eaglescout(the highest rank).  Although this does pretty much sum up the entirety of my childhood because I spent every other weekend in the wilderness.  I should mention the best memory I have from my past is the two weeks I spent in New Mexico.  This time was spent mainly hiking at a high adventure camp ground where we would backpack ten miles a day until we reached our next camp site for the night and had some activity such as rock climbing, canoeing, and all other manner of things.

		<h3>Deciding a Major</h3>
			<p class = "indent"><pre>
			My senior year in high school was not very focused I'm one of those people that could not decide what they wanted to do for the rest of thier life. I finally made myself decide when I was sending out applicatioins to schools so I could choose one with a good program in that field.  In the end I decided on computer science because I have always loved computers.  I had never taken a class in any form directed towards programming, but I am determined to finish what I start.

		<h3>My Goals in Life</h3>
			<p class = "indent"><pre>
			My main goal in life is one that may seem unattainable for most.  I was raised in a low income family, with a sister that had seven kids and was constantly borrowing money, so this gave me the want to be able to make enough money to buy anything I want without having to worry about money.  This may seem like a goal that is run of the mill and hard to accomplish, but since I have grown up with so little I developed so that I actually do not have that many wants in this world.  I tend to be very easy to please and become content fairly easily.
